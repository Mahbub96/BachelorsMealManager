## Technical Implementation

### Role-Based Rendering

```typescript

      return renderAdminInterface();
    case 'member':
    default:
      return renderMemberInterface();
  }
};
```

### Conditional Feature Display

```typescript
// Role-based permissions
const canApproveMeals = role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin';
const canDeleteMeals = role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin';
const canViewAllMeals = role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin';
const canBulkOperate = role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin';
const canViewAnalytics = role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin';
```

### Analytics Integration

```typescript
// Conditional analytics display
{currentView === 'analytics' ? (
  <MealAnalytics
    meals={meals}
    mealStats={mealStats}
    userRole={role as 'admin' | 'member' | 'super_admin'}
  />
) : (
  // Regular meal list view
)}
```
