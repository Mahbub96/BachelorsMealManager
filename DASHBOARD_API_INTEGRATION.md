# Dashboard API Integration

## Overview

The Dashboard has been successfully integrated with the backend API. Previously, the dashboard was using mock data from `MessDataContext`. Now it fetches real data from the API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### Backend (BachelorMessManagerBackend)

1. **Enhanced Dashboard Controller** (`src/controllers/dashboardController.js`)

   - Added comprehensive analytics data methods
   - Implemented weekly meals data generation
   - Added monthly revenue tracking
   - Created expense breakdown functionality
   - Enhanced combined dashboard endpoint with charts data

2. **New API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics
   - `GET /api/dashboard/activities` - Recent activities
   - `GET /api/dashboard` - Combined dashboard data with charts

### Frontend (bachelor-mess-client)

1. **New API Dashboard Component** (`components/dashboard/ApiDashboard.tsx`)

   - Replaces mock data with API calls
   - Uses `useDashboard` hook for data fetching
   - Implements error handling and loading states
   - Supports pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Dynamic timeframe selection (week/month/year)

2. **Updated Main Dashboard** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)

   - Now uses `ApiDashboard` instead of `ModularDashboard`
   - Integrates with real API data

3. **Enhanced Type Definitions** (`services/dashboardService.ts`)
   - Added `charts` property to `CombinedDashboardData` interface
   - Supports weekly meals, monthly revenue, and expense breakdown data

    }
  }
}
```

## Features

### Real-time Data

- Dashboard now shows actual data from the database
- Statistics reflect current mess members, meals, and expenses
- Activities show real user actions and system events

### Interactive Charts

- Weekly meals chart with trend indicators
- Monthly revenue tracking with forecasts
- Expense breakdown by categories
- Progress charts for monthly goals

### Error Handling

- Graceful error display with retry functionality
- Loading states during data fetching
- Offline fallback considerations

### Responsive Design

- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Dynamic timeframe selection
- Mobile-optimized layout

## Testing

To test the API integration:

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd BachelorMessManagerBackend
   npm start
   ```

2. Test API endpoints:

   ```bash
   node test-dashboard-api.js
   ```

3. Run the client app:
   ```bash
   cd bachelor-mess-client
   npm start
   ```

## Migration from Mock Data

The transition from mock data to API data is seamless:

- **Before**: Used `MessDataContext` with hardcoded data
- **After**: Uses `useDashboard` hook with API calls
- **Benefits**: Real-time data, better performance, scalability

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live updates
2. **Caching**: Add intelligent caching for better performance
3. **Offline Support**: Implement offline data storage and sync
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Add more detailed reporting and insights
5. **Custom Dashboards**: Allow users to customize their dashboard layout

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Failed**

   - Check if backend server is running
   - Verify API base URL in `config.ts`
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Authentication Errors**

   - Ensure user is logged in
   - Check JWT token validity
   - Verify user permissions

3. **Data Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Check database connectivity

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in the client:

```typescript
// In config.ts
export const ENV_CONFIG = {
  development: {
    logLevel: 'debug',
    enableMockData: false, // Set to false for API data
  },
};
```

## Conclusion

The Dashboard now successfully integrates with the backend API, providing real-time data and enhanced functionality. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while offering improved user experience and data accuracy.
